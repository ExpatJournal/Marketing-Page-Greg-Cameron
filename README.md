These are the marketing pages for the Expat Jounal app. There is a landing page and an about me page. It has been bootstrapped for the navigation dropdown and uses less files for the styling.

Everything is in a wrapper div with a width of 960 pixels.

Sections, and child containers are set to height: fit-contetnt so that they get longer when the screen is narrower, shorter when it is wider.

The section on the landing page has two main child divs, sign-up and intro.

I used flexbox container divs. Look for the .custom-container in the less files. its a mixin for setting flex direction, justification, and align items.

There are media query mixins for phones and small phones (sPhone).
